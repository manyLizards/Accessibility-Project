# Accessibility-Project
## Description
The first project of UT's Coding bootcamp in which I must ensure that the code provided to me adheres to the accessibility guidelines. I was eager to prove my ability to make a website accessible.
The starter code is a main landing page for a company called Horiseon. It provides information on marketing for businesses, but was lacking some images, alt image defining words, and the layout was inaccurate to how the client wanted it. I learned how to fix these errors to keep in mind differently-abled people and make the website accessible.
